    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates an Agentic AI framework designed to automate and enhance \n",
    "the process of generating personalized customer product recommendations within a banking context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Core Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agentic AI solution systematically executes the following sequence of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommendation Logic Definition: Explicitly defines the business rules and constraints \n",
    "  governing customer-product matching and recommendation generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Data Generation: Programmatically generates or simulates a CSV file containing \n",
    "  comprehensive customer profile and transaction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Assignment and Augmentation: Applies the defined recommendation logic to \n",
    "  the customer data, systematically adding recommended banking products (e.g., checking account, savings accounts)\n",
    "  to each customer record.\n"

    "- Data Module: The get_customers function, sourced from the Customer_data module, responsible for generating or fetching the customer dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Environment Management: The python-dotenv library to securely manage and load environment variables (e.g., API keys, configuration settings) from a .env file.\n"
